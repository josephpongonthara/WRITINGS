            Buttered shrimp in a salad. Sounds mad, if that’s what you thought, congratulations, correct. 
            Risotto with glistening glazed vegetables coating some of its surface. That makes up for it.
        </p>

            My hunger satisfied, I proceeded to the real challenge of the evening, wine selection. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Toscani sounded earthy with a hint of citrus to finish, a perfect complement. After indulging in a few dozen ounces I was greeted by an adversary.        </p>
        <p>
            Standing around 5 feet 11 inches, I was naturally intimidated. 
            Upon seeing her jet-black hair, her hourglass figure in a matching jet-black dress & her arms covered with the heathens from Sodom & Gomorrah, 
            I took a heavy gulp & braced for impact.        
        </p>
        <p>
            Her body was a masterpiece, also serving as a canvas for the finest tattoo artists of our time, she was a gift for this world to admire, 
            objectify, belittle & berate. 
            It was no fault of her own, just a curse she was born to bear, although from her poised & seductive demeanor, 
            I could tell she had embraced the character & made it her own. 
        </p>
        <p>
            She sat two stools to my right. My liquid courage was escaping me. 
            I began clutching my glass, praying that some form of charm would take over my being, to no avail. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I peered from the corner of my eye & noticed a faint smile start to form from her left cheek.
            “Children, children, children. Man, woman, boy girl.” Had I found myself seated next to a prophetic schizophrenic? 
            “Do I seriously have to babysit you?”, she was not facing me, but she began to slide a glass of water over to me. 
            As I began gulping it down, I began to imagine this woman as my babysitter. 
            What a steamy affair that would be; me, a handsome junkie, turning the personification of female sex appeal into my concubine, 
            so that one day me & my child could simultaneously suck on her breasts. 
            As though she could read my mind, I received a slap on the back of my head. 
            Perhaps it was the intensity with which I was drinking the water. “Follow me, we have a job to do.”
        </p>

            I had never been pimped out before so there was no real cause for concern. 
            We stepped outside, rain was pouring around us but fortunately the Amazonian queen had an umbrella. 
            Guiding us to the Jaguar pulling up for us I felt another slap on the back of my head. 
            I turned my head to see a cloth being pushed toward my mouth & nose. Gamma Hydroxybutyrate. Night time.
