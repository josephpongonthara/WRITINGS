            Frederick is a company man. 
            Blinded by the opulence and excess often associated with High Fashion boutiques, he had devoted his life to pussy footing with, & providing the finest hand jobs to fashion’s most powerful patriarchs. 
            For all his efforts he still only manages to man the front desk at Valentino’s 5th avenue storefront, passing on customers to more seasoned tailors & seamstresses, making flirtatious remarks before they can escape his reach. 
            These quips are loathed by Valentino patrons & employees alike. 
            No one likes Frederick.

            Frederick is an ugly fellow. 
            For no fault of his own he was orphaned as a child due to his disfigured face & rancid odour not far behind whenever he enters the room.

            The 50s were a difficult time for outcasts & free-loaders. 
            The ostracized were ostracized by those who were ostracized. 
            Frederick grew out his moustache, filled his closet with neon boot-cuts & silk button-ups, & even adopted a small limp with a straight back, implying he had his asshole obliterated by a local hunk. 
            But for a hideous creature like Frederick it was hard to fool the observant homosexual aware of all the idiosyncrasies that present itself after engaging in sodomy. 
            Frederick was a faggot to the fags.

            His only form or companionship came from the local bodega owner Tran. 
            A Vietnamese immigrant, Tran ran the bodega by day & slept in a telephone closet sized room located right above the store. 
            Every Wednesday, Tran & Frederick would gather at Tran’s to share Vietnamese spring-rolls, 4-Lokos & tales of their adventures from the week. 
            Tran didn’t speak English nor Frederick Vietnamese. 
            At the end of their rendezvous, Tran would slip Frederick a tobacco tin filled with percocets. This transaction was the highlight of Fredrick’s week.
