        <p>
            Without fail at the end of every day my thoughts flee to her. 
            Scrolling through texts, music recommendations, pictures in my camera roll, all bring a smile to not only my face but my soul. 
            She’s an escape from all the predicaments I currently find myself in. 
            I ponder how she’s holding up, hopefully not held up in someone else’s arms but then again I can’t complain I haven’t had the courage to tell her how I feel. 
            Writing is the best form of therapy, my true feelings can be documented. 
            I’ve never opened up about these feelings, and albeit to myself, it’s rewarding all the same.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Quantifying affection is a difficult thing. Do I find her attractive, yes. 
            Do her cheeks glow anytime she flashes a smile, yes. 
            Does she carry an infectious care free demeanour, yes. 
            Does my heart sky or sink depending on her presence in the room, yes. 
            All these signs clearly display my feelings but tackling them head on is another hurdle I feel rather contempt to leave alone after all the ones I’ve leaped past already.
        </p>
        <p>
            She is unique beyond compare.
            I find myself lost when in her presence, no drug can match the jittery childlike excitement I get when I let my eyes wander a room and allow them to stumble in her direction. 
            She carries herself with such grace, elegantly sifting through personalities, knowing what to say, when to say it, yet never straying from her true character. 
            She can command and caress, like Ginger in Vegas. 
            Unparalleled range.  
        </p>
        <p>
            She is everything to me. 
            I’ve debated writing that but analyzing the patterns it’s nothing short of the truth. 
            My mood can be swung in either direction from one text, a side eye can send my mind swirling searching for reasons, a laugh will take me to euphorias beyond the bounds of this reality. 
            Do I fear dependency, wholeheartedly. 
            But fears are to be conquered, and for her, I wholeheartedly overestimated my courageousness.
