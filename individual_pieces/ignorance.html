            The pile increases. 
            A steady flow of people with paper stream in and out of the room at what would appear to some as an alarming rate, 
            but for the editor of MUSE it has become routine. 
            Drafts, ads, masthead concept design, mediocre photography, front page pitches, freelance pieces, and comics cover the surface area of her ever-expanding desk. 
            Her left drawer is filled with empty bottles of Adderall, this job is draining but she’s losing weight. 
            Sacrificing her mental sanity in order to fit into her newly purchased Ritu Kumar sari is an easy bargain for her. 
            If anything it’s like an additional side hustle she is content with adding to her plate.

            The time nears noon. 
            Her doctor has prescribed ‘chlordiazepoxide’ for her anxiety. 
            Upon investigation it appears that this farrago of letters was formerly known as Librium, one of the pioneer drugs that provided the Sackler’s with their wealth. 
            She doesn’t want to help fund the opioid crisis but her lack of sleep, trembling hands, rumbling stomach from her poor digestion, all fuel the urge to pill pop. 
            In they go, Librium, followed by an Adderall. 
            She can afford to miss lunch, can’t forget the all important sari.

            A friendly face knocks on her door, she leans on the door frame while dangling a set of keys setting off dopamine for Joanne. 
            The anticipation builds as her eyes dart towards the clock gently placed on top of the looseleaf mountain. 2:45. 
            “Hungry babes?”, nodding Joanne throws her coat over her shoulder, grabs a handful of wallet, AirPods, keys and storms out the door. 
            Everyone in her world operates at her riveting pace. 
            No one stops to think or question. What is the need for her hastiness. 
            As she continues down the hallway, leading the way to her colleague’s car she is hounded with requests, 
            demands, energetic dreamers and depressed pragmatists, perhaps it’s the juxtaposition of a writers room that makes her feel so at home, 
            but she ignores them all, waltzes through the elevator doors and bids her admirers adieu. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The elevator ride is silent. 
            Exiting the building and entering the car sets off a wave of relief in her mind. 
            Gripping her mug of ayahuasca and caffeine, she embraces her much needed reset. 
            She hates her work, yet she’s addicted, every article reads aloud in her mind as she begins the filtration process. 
            She has found her peace. 
            She finishes her drink and heads back into the office. 
            Mask on.
