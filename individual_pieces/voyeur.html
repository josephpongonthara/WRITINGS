            The flight to Istanbul was turbulent, whether it be the inebriated pilot fucking a variety of flight attendants, 
            the bombs being dropped on the Islamic State or perhaps it was just the 300 pound whale sitting beside me rocking the flight with every deep breath, 
            there was no escaping the discomfort often associated with arriving in a distant land. 
            Regardless my excitement to continue my dissipated behaviour had not diminished. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Separate from the countless vices that hold me prisoner, a new slave master decided to add to my misery & introduce me to a new way of life. 
            I’m not a masochist just yet but the sensation from my ears violently popping during the descent is definitely one I would welcome again. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I don’t plan on staying here long so the goal is to make as many enemies as possible in the shortest time frame. 
            As I go through customs I was shocked that my suitcase full of pig intestines & honey jars was confiscated. 
            “Haram” the workers shout at me in unison. 
            As a retort I fling my Star of David like a ninja star, killing one, then take my faces covered bible & smear it across the dead man’s face. 
            Perhaps out of pure shock the workers stare at the corpse with no reaction. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Perfect, escape time. I grab my backpack & make a run for it, the workers along with my fellow flight passengers form a mob & chase after me. 
            I’m hit with a wave of sadness & feelings of betrayal, I was one of them, how could they turn on me! 
            Any-who I carry on and stumble into a lineup of cabs. 
            As an individual who struggles with crippling indecisiveness this was the worst possible scenario to present itself during my ongoing witch-hunt. 
            I stare up at the sky, “Lord please tell me which cab to choose!”, the Lord answers, “Son, you have vertigo why would stare up like that!”, I retort, “Hubris I suppose.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The Turks escort me to their airport prison. 
            A quite pleasant space actually. 
            They ask me to take a seat at the end of a circular table; of the many adventures I’ve experienced in life this was perhaps the most difficult challenge I’ve ever faced. 
            I take a seat at the ‘end’ & begin my mental preparation for the ensuing torture. 
            To my surprise I’m presented with a 10oz Americano with almond milk & 2 sugars, coupled with a coffee cream filled croissant topped with shredded coconut. 
            In fear that the items had been poisoned I ask my captor to take the inaugural bite & sip, he obliges & I am comforted. 
        </p>
        <p>
            He presents me with an ultimatum, either I agree to not make any more enemies during my stay or I’ll be lathered with honey, 
            forced to chow down on pig intestines all while being walked on a leash by a local prostitute as she yells “Piggy, piggy, piggy, my sweet piggy!” 
            Not the worst form of torture I would have experienced but I agree to my captors terms & end my mental preparation. 
            Before departing to go explore this beautiful city I have the urge to impart some advice onto my captor. 
            “Next time you present a prisoner with an ultimatum don’t seat them at a wobbly table, it’s distracting.” 
            My captor’s face turns to a scowl & he cries “PIGGY!” Time to run again.
