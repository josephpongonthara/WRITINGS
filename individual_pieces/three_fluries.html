            One, two, seven, twelve, staring up into the dimly lit night sky I continue counting. 
            Infinite little specs whizzing about, scurrying onto my nose or whipping my eyelids like a chopper. 
            Every breath becomes more laborious with every passing second. 
            The job is complete, but I still feel blank inside. Perhaps it’s the nature of snow shoveling in the midst of an ongoing storm that leaves one desiring more. 
            The job will never be complete in that sense, one more hour and all progress made will be lost and it’s back to square one. 
            Waltzing into the backyard I’m distraught upon seeing my snow chair defiled. Where is this heinous criminal. 
            Through the back bushes a pair of piercing blue eyes stare into my soul. All of a sudden my body feels the chill from the winter air, shivers shoot up and down my spine, I’m frozen.

            Infinite little specs whizzing about, scurrying onto my nose or whipping my eyelids like a chopper. 
            The stars extend into violent streaks altering my depth perception. 
            My heart rate continues to rise as pace increases, I look to my left, then right, how can this be, I’m not alone. 
            Shaped like an ergonomic mouse I see Paige cutting through the air like Bond’s Aston Martin on the streets of Rome. 
            Humbled and ashamed I accept defeat and cruise into the ramp ahead, one last jump to cap an evening of aerodynamic testing. 
            Whimpers sound from the snow bank ahead, it’s difficult to see with the wind firing snow flakes into my eyes like bullets but I can make out a body, 
            I’m certain it’s Paige but she does have a knack to exaggerate so I’m sure she’s fine. 
            The whimpers stop, calming my anxiety, but like a Tyson feint into a hook she begins to twitch and will not respond to my voice. 
            Stuck in a whirlwind of indecisiveness and concern, I freeze and proceed to panic.

            To some, torture is a form of creative expression. 
            Across cultures there are unique, heinous and sometimes head scratching forms of torture. 
            With each step of my makeshift snowshoes through the streets of Oymyakon I lose desire. 
            Desire to eat, desire to breath, I’ve been forced to walk through this now uninhabited town for the past 30 hours, 
            with each step I lose feeling, all that remains is the pain as the tips of my fingers freeze off. 
            How did I get here, in these final moments I’m able to reminisce but nothing comes to mind, no memories of experiences or relationships, 
            all I know is this dark frozen tundra.
