        <p>
            The last few days have been spent in hyper orbit. 
            As a result, I have become dependent on various forms of transportation, most of it public, to keep the circus in business. 
            Having now been fully immersed into the ecosystem of the following services I have taken it upon myself to conduct a comprehensive comparison of the TTC & GO transit ventilation systems.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Having spent most of my semi-professional career in this area, I suppose this is the one time you can trust what you’re reading is only 40% bullshit. 
            Despite it’s overpriced, aggressive & obnoxiously noisy ventilation system circulating air at an excessive CFM rate; 
            the GO’s air filtration system fulfills the primary goal of any respectable air filtration system. 
            Minimize hideous odours exiting the perspiring pores of its innumerable, inconsiderate, mostly overweight, patrons.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the sake of transparency, I should disclose that I have been accused of being a smelly fellow by many of my dearest friends; 
            however, I have & will continue to vehemently deny all of these fallacious claims. 
            This has nothing to do with my ability to objectively analyze ventilation systems, I said it purely to defend my honour. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to ventilation, the TTC applies the risk to reward principle in a very unique way. 
            Maximize risk while minimizing reward so as to create a hostile, uncomfortable, yet incredibly comedic environment which lends itself well to all the heathens, provocateurs, provocatrixes & rough-jacks of the city. 
            You will more often than not finish your TTC excursion with one or more of the following scents: 
            AXE cologne coming from a local fanook in jorts, 
            the unique smell of sweat specific only to the underside of a BBW’s breasts as her cardiovascular system panics due to her overexertion from overeating, 
            or a fresh takeout bag from ‘The Owl of Minerva’
        </p>
        <p>
            Leaving the TTC craving a deep cleanse is the most likely outcome after any trip; however, 
            the occasional whiff of fresh Baseema exuding from the bottom-less purse of a Sudanese grandma, 
            that she’s bringing on the 85 to her grandchildren at Meadowvale & Sheppard, 
            will certainly restore your belief in human purity, momentarily at least.
