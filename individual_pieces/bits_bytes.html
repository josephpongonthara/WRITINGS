            Bits & Bytes, I study with fear.<br>
            It must be done, I’m sorry my dear.<br>
            “Is our date night cancelled?”, she asks with dread.<br>
            Her eyes swell with anger, is she gonna fill me with lead?<br>
            All the time spent in paranoia, has now turned to hate.<br>
            My biggest fear to fruition, she’s becoming irate!<br>
            “I love you”, I cry, the words no longer hold weight.<br>
            My life cuts too black, I’ve turned into Tony today.<br>
