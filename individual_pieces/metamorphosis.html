            My evening begins sipping an overpriced, overly bitter key-lime seltzer, gazing romantically at the pedestrians cruising along King street. 
            I’m pondering the concept of belief; how powerful, intoxicating & effective it can be. 
            Belief evokes passion, selflessness, courage, love. 
            It’s the reason I sit here patiently, anxious, nervous. 
            About to aimlessly wander & waste money wishing for the unlikely possibility that I can live out a fantasy I’ve imagined this morning. 
        </p>

            My evening ends with a nurse removing my clothes in a hospital bed I could only categorize as half twin, siamese size. 
            Shivers shoot up my spine as I prepare for the most erotic, degrading, bone chilling foreplay of my short lifetime. 
            Restlessness starts to cloud my thoughts as my curiosity heightens, I was content with experiencing, but piecing together the preceding events is becoming increasingly difficult only adding to my mounting anxiety. 
            I’m too fixated on the single hair marking the space that would be the exact centre of her unibrow, 
            that I forget to inquire about my concerns. 
            Opening my mouth she places a small pill on my tongue and I swallow, “enjoy the ride love.”

            What prompts an act. At our core, survival. Ok, but beyond that, what is beyond survival? 
            Pleasure? Fulfillment? Approval? Superiority? Misogyny? Pansexuality? 
        </p>

            Why does a brothel owner revel in toying around with a sweaty, coked-up patron in his dark & damp corridor? 
            How does a pilot forget the pure sensual pleasure of a lover’s touch when they reach the upper echelon’s of the earth’s atmosphere? 
            How can an aristocratic artisan baker produce a perfectly wheaty, fluffy, dense dough, creating the most nuanced patterns with them, 
            while simultaneously destroying his lungs, scarring them with tar from the infinite packs he devours in his establishment? 
            The preacher will try to show you the way of the Lord, the psychiatrist will try to show you the way of the Pharma.

            Directions & possibilities are infinite, box yourself in & you will be the perfect outline for a gingerbread house, 
            let yourself loose & that perfectly carved gingerbread house can become the home for an endless stream of pleasurable, meaningless debauchery.

            I’m surrounded by cages, at least that’s what I can depict from the moonlight reflecting off their iron bars. 
            It’s musty with the occasional gust of winter air causing every penis within a mile radius to shrivel back into its mother’s pouch. 
            I hear whimpers, laughs, whips, squeals & cheers, yet I can’t see a thing. 
            I’m hoping to get a blowjob soon but I think my rights have been sold. 
            The auctioneer calls my name & begins to list off numbers increasing in increments of 50, although I’m famished, naked, cold & alone, at least I have value in this filthy tavern.

            A bell rings out, possessing the space & its patrons. A silence so powerful my ears continue to ring with the sound of the bell. 
            I feel fingers pulling at my ears, tongue & cheeks. A gentle slap on my ass & I’m lifted by each limb. 
            I still can’t see, only feel. My pallbearers march in harmony, a sound quite pleasant for the blind. 
            As my eyes set, & my mind starts to drift I see my nurse again, finally blowjob time! 
            She knows what I want, she gives my dick a gentle slap, hands me my clothes, my wallet & phone, & gives me a kiss on the cheek. “Welcome back.”
