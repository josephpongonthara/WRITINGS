            My hands have been sweating bullets like a criminal in an interrogation room.<br>
            In a way it’s quite symbolic.<br>
            I, the criminal, clearly didn’t prepare enough.<br>
            How on earth did they find the body?<br>
            Someone must have ratted.<br>
            As I survey the room, anxiety building, anger peaking, sorrow slowly fills my heart.<br>
            I have been betrayed by a comrade, someone I’ve fought alongside the past 3 years.<br>
            My eyes fixate on the window in front of me.<br>
            I’ve given up on finding the rat.<br>
            Ignorance is bliss & my heart could not handle the pain anyways.<br>
            Through the blinds I can see the gentle wind caressing the newly grown leaves.<br>
            Like a newborn experiencing all the joys of the earth, I wonder if they feel euphoric as the wind cools their surface.<br>
            What am I doing?<br>
            Why have I personified a leaf?<br>
            I’m still staring though.<br>
            The edges past the blinds are poking out.<br>
            The test time is almost done, the world is showing its face to me again.<br>
            I realize I’ve probably failed this test.<br>
            At least the 10 minutes spent writing this was enjoyable.<br>
            I’ve maintained my focus on the window, its oddly captivating.<br>
            There’s something so familiar about it.<br>
            It’s a reflection. That’s why.<br>
            The betrayal is destroying me.<br>
            No comrade could ever possibly disappoint me this much.<br>
            As I see myself in the reflection, I now know who the rat is.<br>
            It’s me.<br>
