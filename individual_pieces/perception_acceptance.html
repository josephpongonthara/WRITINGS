            3 pizzas in, 3 pizzas out, we are in steady-state. 
            That is the sole calculation completed this day. 
            My sensory deprivation tank experience has begun. Discombobulated from the jump, the day started at a net negative.
            Belt, pant and vape missing. 
            Two thirds have been recovered but my soul is lying drenched & squashed on the floors of the grungiest establishment waterloo’s mid-south-east has to offer.
        </p>
        <p> 
            “South-mid-east, south-east-mid, east-mid-south, east-south-mid, or mid-east-south? That is the problem I pose to all interested parties. Welcome to your Jane Street interview.” 
            Those lines haunt my soul, filling it with trauma. 
            I was anticipating the highest-order of mental fuckery known to man, instead I was escorted out the building.
        </p>
        <p>
            You’d be surprised at the alcohol consumption rate of long jump competition goers.
            Finally, I felt at home. The stands were packed, the room buzzing with misplaced excitement. 
            My ears are ringing with meaningful white noise, coherent conversations on complex subjects all of which sound so bloody important! 
            Pulling off my mask, I turn to the 2 bodies who have followed me for 2579 steps: “DON’T FUCKING HOVER!” The room goes quiet, lovely. 
            Finally, I can focus on the long jump competition. 
            One by one athletes step up and execute. 
            The favourites, the respected, the silently despised, the over-confident cringe brigade, the hustlers, & reek. 
            My boss says nothing but maintains a consistent eye on my reactions. 
            I’m simultaneously amazed and nauseous. 
            Athletic brilliance will always be one of few things in life I can appreciate without much convincing, 
            but the horrendous odour flowing out of the pores of every event attendee is making it hard for any neutral or first-time attendee to ponder the morality of bio-terrorism in outrageous circumstances such as this one. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Similar to biking down Front-street during rush hour, navigating past the streetcars, oblivious pedestrians, 
            aimless uber drivers & the occasional motorcade carrying pretentious politicians or celebrities, 
            maneuvering a packed crowd provides the same dopamine rush any thrill seeker would welcome. 
            Bobbing my head like Ben Affleck on his way across the bar to chat up some ‘Hah-vahd honeys’, 
            I nimbly avoid any physical contact or unpleasant obstacles for my nostrils. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Arriving at the detonation location, I cycle through the various methods to wreak havoc. 
            After filtering through various deplorable options of terrorism, violence and outright pettiness I settle on the perfect mix of all three worlds. 
            After placing the timed explosives in the underbelly every stall, I return to my post and take my place among the rest of the jesters here to take part in the emperor’s spectacle of distraction. 
            Tick, tock, tick, tock.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 2 bodies continue to hover but from a distance this time. 
            Despite my obstructed nostrils sifting through the various of hideous odours engulfing the arena, I can sense their presence, 
            and their intense gaze locked onto my body observing every facial movement I make.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The next athlete steps up, the arena goes silent anticipating the upcoming athletic excellence. 
            BOOM, the starting gun goes off, with every lunge he makes, every breath gets shorter, pupils dart from one position to the next trying to predict where he’ll land, 
            as he approaches the launch line, I see one head turn. 
            Then another. And another. 
            Like a school of fish navigating the crevices of a coral reef, every head turns away from athlete and towards the back of the arena.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feces and urine gush from washroom and project onto all the long jump competition viewers. 
            Panic ensues as everyone attempts to stomp over another in order to escape the disgusting mess that they made. 
            As the hall clears, and the scent of sweat and attempt sweat scent repellent displaced by a new yet similar smell, 
            a stand alone in a pool of urine and feces which now cover the floor. 
            I look for the two bodies who accompanied me on this wonderful excursion but fail to find them. 
            Finally at peace, proud of accomplishment, I await to my future employer’s approval. 
            As I look to the box seats that he owns we lock eyes and I can’t help but smile.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can feel his gaze poking around my soul and butterflies fill my stomach. 
            He maintains his stare for a few seconds then turns and departs, followed by the two bodies who I thought were meant to escort me out of the building.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alone in the hall, I revel in the new project I completed thinking about how to incorporate it on my resume.
