            Bells & whistles ring at the Notre Dame filling the Parisian sky with pigeons. 
            Part of me wishes they lined the steps leading up to the cathedral with their shit as they flew away. 
            Perhaps that level of foreshadowing would have been too obvious for the newly-wed couple, but to live in the truth is cruel, 
            & difficult for the feeble minded, any who I still wished it happened all the same. 
            But like most dreams in life they stay that way, so I put out my cigarette & continued walking.
        </p>
        <p> 
            To the right of the cathedral entrance lies the l’Hôpital Hôtel Dieu. 
            In my opinion a more fitting companion for the cathedral would be a psychiatric institution but I suppose the hospital’s psych ward should suffice.

            I cannot stay on islands for too long, so I turn left onto the ‘Rue de la Cité’, cross the bridge over the ‘Seine’ & make my way into mainland Paris. 
            It never fails to amaze me how a river of that size can just pass through a major metropolitan area but I never paid attention in geology so perhaps that explains it. 
        </p>

            Upon approaching the university I notice that the street name has changed to ‘Rue Saint Jacques’. 
            Another thing I never understood is why the same street has multiple names, but then again who wouldn’t love to have another identify, a fresh start. 
            Even inanimate objects deserve rights.

            I’m craving a Tim’s breakfast sandwich, my diet so far has consisted of cigarettes & crepes, I need some protein, 
            if only they had bodegas in this aristocratic town. 
            Paying for roaming doesn’t fit into the budget for a full-time disgraced engineer, bartender & bike messenger, so google maps has to be put away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every inch of this town is covered in restaurants without an affordable fast food spot in sight, 
            all this time in limbo is not helping my nicotine craving. 
            I have a joint & a bogue, but it’s only 1:30 so the marijuana will have to be put away for a later hour. 
            I don’t enjoy walking & smoking. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After scouting for a suitable location for such debauchery I settle on an alley laden with stacks of empty beer bottles, 
            cardboard cutouts of various national team players & a bin filled with expired electronics. 
            There was a point when I was pleased with the world’s decision to ignore all environmental repercussions, 
            but now as I become more attached to the living instead of humans I despise my previous immature ideologies.
        </p>

            I put my AirPods away & reach for my lighter. Right pocket, nothing, left, nothing, both back ones, nothing. 
            FUCK. Rage fills my soul at the realization that my momentary head & body rush will have to wait another 20 minutes. 
            Upon striking the electronics bin I’m immediately filled with disappointment & regain my rational mind. I really need to start vaping again.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I make my way out of that hole of neglected responsibilities & shattered dreams, I hear a soft whimper, 
            emerging from behind the bin, a withered French bulldog, it’s black skin covered in brown spots of which I can’t differentiate is his actual fur or dirt. 
            His legs wobble with every step & from his demeanour you can tell he wants to intimidate but has no fuel in the tank.
        </p>

            I scramble through my pockets & backpack for something to keep this lad going. 
            All I could muster was some Cheetos & a bottle of water; beggars can’t be choosers, sorry little man this is all I got. 
            I lay the bag of Cheetos on the ground & fold my rain jacket into something that resembles a bowl & fill it up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Almost seeing a flashback from my younger days, the small fellow scarfs down the chips & gulps the water in a flash. 
            I give him a gentle tap on the head & continue with my day. 
            The little lad tries to follow but despise the little snack can’t get his legs to keep up. 
            As I leave the alley onto the sidewalk I hear the soft whimper again. I can barely take care of myself, what am I supposed to do with this thing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My rain jacket has turned into a useful multipurpose object, I morph it from a bowl to a bed & lay it next to my new pal. 
            I return from the local convenience store with a lighter, Cheetos & water. 
            After laying down the bag of Cheetos & filling my rain jacket with water I finally get to smoke.
