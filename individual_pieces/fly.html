            The sound of a burning match soothes my soul. 
            Step one, ignition. 
            The crackle from the match grinding against the corrugated surface along the side of the match box fulfills our innate human desire for conflict & punishment. 
            Suffering is the catalyst for redemption & seeing that flame burn bright foreshadows our own form of redemption.

            I’m obsessed with the ambiance of the street. Not the violent life of crime often associated with that word but the street itself. 
            Every street tells a different story. Some tattered & torn, others freshly refurbished with the potent smell of freshly paved asphalt filling everyone’s nostrils. 
            Every street sees hundreds, thousands, maybe even millions of lives. I think that’s why I’m in love biking, 
            I feel one with the street, free to explore & observe. 
            That is when I’m the happiest.

            Hopefully one day I can share it with someone. When she arrives how will I know? 
            That is probably my biggest fear. 
            Sometimes I’m the fakest person I know. 
            There are many encounters of introduction to women where I put on my makeup & try to be who I think they want me to be thinking that that is what they want me to be. 
            In reality they just want me to be me. 
            At least she will.
