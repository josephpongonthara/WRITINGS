            I’ve come so far only to be slapped in the face. 
            Humiliation, inferiority, powerlessness is all I feel. 
            Dealing with someone as manipulative as Stallin with his generals has turned me into a shell of myself. 
            “Boar on the floor, boar on the floor, boar on the floor!” 
            Those words echo throughout my mind like the rings of Chiropteran’s in the attic of the Peterson’s. 
            I am a hopeless romantic who’s lost meaning with his life.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Why you ask? What is the catalyst for all this misery & gloom invading my thoughts at every waking hour? 
            I haven’t been with a woman in a year and some change.
        </p>

            I’m a handsome fellow. Especially recently, so it’s not for lack of opportunity. 
            Beyond my knowing I haven’t turned homosexual; I haven’t gotten a boner from looking at an attractive man yet so that possibility can be ruled out. 
            Religious fanaticism hasn’t taken its hold over me. 
            I’m not saving my body for the Lord (I already said I’m not a faggot). 
            My mind is still filled with sick sexual fantasies from the devil, I can assure you that. 
            Another possibility that can be ruled out. For those of you that know me, & if you’re reading this you definitely do, I’m not seeking commitment. 
            I’m a narcissist at my core, my body convulses at the thought of giving up that tightly reserved love to another. 
            Another possibility ruled out.

            When it comes to ventilation, the TTC applies the risk to reward principle in a very unique way. 
            Maximize risk while minimizing reward so as to create a hostile, uncomfortable, yet incredibly comedic environment which lends itself well to all the heathens, provocateurs, provocatrixes & rough-jacks of the city. 
            You will more often than not finish your TTC excursion with one or more of the following scents: 
            AXE cologne coming from a local fanook in jorts, 
            the unique smell of sweat specific only to the underside of a BBW’s breasts as her cardiovascular system panics due to her overexertion from overeating, 
            or a fresh takeout bag from ‘The Owl of Minerva’
        </p>

            I wrote a story a few months back titled ‘Fringe Faggot’. 
            Loosely inspired by the ’The Talented Mr. Ripley’, to shitty to share, & definitely not about a homosexual. 
            Its purpose was to discuss the emotional equivalent of edging. 
            An individual on the cusp of intimacy, choosing to curb the interest of the collective in favor of his/her own. 
            Why? Because there is satisfaction in secrecy. 
            And for those constantly plagued with fear of other’s judgment, it’s a perfect sanctuary to lock up inner desires & enjoy them for yourself without anyone’s approval or condescension. 
            This is where the problem lies. I’ve chosen to set aside all my inherent sexual perversions to lie in this abyss of loneliness. 
            I want to leave, I know I can leave, but I haven’t & don’t know when or if I’ll leave. Why?
        </p>
        <p>
            I don’t know. 
        </p>
