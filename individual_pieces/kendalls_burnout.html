            I sit in a room of people filled with ambition. 
            Invigorated by wealth, competition & acceptance. 
            Every head goes up & down 45 degrees along the z-axis, with eyes fixating intensely on what appears to me as gibberish. 
            At first I loathed their desire to understand & conquer. Now it is quite beautiful to me. 
            My mother prays to St Jude the Apostle everyday that I too will be filled with the spirit (Holy or Evil), but unfortunately my prior predisposition to give into fantasies has disappeared, nowadays I prefer to play Fifth Business. 
        </p>

            I need to find a driving force, what moves me, I prefer to complain than to work but I eventually always give into the task at hand. 
            Why? Self reflection is cumbersome and tiring, enough of that.

            Every girl has been staring into my eyes intensely at the gym. 
            Cause comes before effect, so what’s the cause? Three options. 
            I am unimaginably attractive these days, 
            I reek so badly to a point that I am immune to my own bioterrorism, or I am simply an excellent imaginative exaggerator. 
            It’s the latter. Unfortunately.

            I have been thinking a lot about love recently. Does love translate beyond our species? 
            Does a dog feel love towards its owner or pups? Does a leaf love the branch it sits upon? 
            Does a mother goose love its child or is it merely an inherent biological makeup comprising of intense loyalty? 
            Maybe that’s it, to love is to be unconditionally loyal. 
            But then I would have to become the gimp from Pulp Fiction, and I can’t afford that suit right now so I guess love will have to wait.

            I’m going to start writing the N word. “I’m a liar, I’m a faggot”. Shoutout Tyler.
