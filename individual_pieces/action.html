            It’s 3:30AM. My eyelids are pounding from the beeping alarm reverberating through my ear drums. 
            I want to keep them closed but the irritation is exceeding an annoyance level unprecedented for even the horniest mosquito.
        </p>
        <p> 
            1 drill, 4 bolts, 1 camera, & 4 extras. A wide-angle lens, stabilized at the center of the front window of a TTC bus. 
            My first film, I’ve been waiting for this day since I was 20 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately for me, I had the extras sign NDAs. 
            Not because I was afraid that they would talk after filming, that would not be possible, more so the ease of knowing my Jewish lawyer, 
            Wagner, would be able to easily dispose of the bodies & having random souls sign NDAs made me feel powerful. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I had my finest Chemist brought in, alongside my finest Surgeon. 
            We had some drinks the night before with a touching moment where we all sang Mendelssohn’s Ave Maria, 3 guys, 8 parts, unbelievable. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Chemist’s cologne was a powerful sedative, unbeknownst to the extras, they entered the bus, &, well, they were sedated. 
            The Surgeon & I were safe, we had rufied each other and left to have sex. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Surgeon returned, disappointed & bruised. He stitched the mouths and eyelids shut of each extra. 
            The stitches that dissolved in their mouth, not remaining there for the world to see, we’re not animals. 
            Next, the eyelids. Having stitched them shut, it seemed quite easy for the Surgeon, maneuvering around the creases of the eyeball, 
            cutting off the skin, leaving a perfectly proportioned, eyehole for each eyeball. 
            We sat them upright, placed them 2 by 2 in the seats designated for folks with disabilities. 
            Time to record.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was excited to start my new career as a filmmaker & my part time career as a bus driver. 
            I started at 5:30, picked up my first batch, then the second, then the third, then the fourth, then the fifth, 
            then the sixth, then the seventeenth, then the eightysixth, then took a shit, then the eightyseventh, then the ninetysecond, then I was done. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The 8k camera focused on the middle seat of the back row captured every lifeless face, as they continued their lifelong routine, survival. 
        </p>
        <p>
            No one noticed the extras. I threw away the footage, what a horrible movie.
        </p>
