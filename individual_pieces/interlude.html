            Introspection is a vice best complemented with cocaine. A pogo stick to help you jump in and out of the bottomless pit.

            This not a tale of marauding narcissists conquering new lands, nor sexually fluid romantics seizing every opportunity to make others uncomfortable. 
            It is an honest reflection. Who am I & Why am I.

            Identity is like the imaginary unit in a complex number. 
            You can assign it value by coupling it with real numbers, but at its core it’s an unknown. 
            I’ve always, mistakenly, attached personality interests to the imaginary unit. 
            For those less mathematically inclined, the imaginary unit in a complex number is the square root of negative one. 
            What makes it imaginary is that you can never actually obtain the square root of a negative number which is why it must be attached to a real number. 
            I’ve attached my race, financial background, social status, athletic ability & academic ability as the primary component of my identity. 
            As most rational, egotistical humans do, I compare. When you attach your identity to a defined comparable unit, you often times feel inferior, 
            which can result in anger, jealousy, self-loathing and worst of all, a desire to switch the real number component to your identity.

            Character building is both constructive and destructive. 
            A unique tool to project problems and assess them from a third person perspective. 
            There are in-numerous avenues to trot down, intoxicating ideas that captivate, send goosebumps up and down your spine, 
            they possess you. One of my many exercises in futility has been obsessing over new characters & romanticizing their life into mine. 
            Tony, Moltisanti, Pinkman, Darius, Rust, and soon McNulty. 
            I’ve always tried to avoid uncertainty with people. 
            I enjoy it with adventures but when it comes to relationships, I never like to stray from knowns. 
            They fear Rust, they respect Tony, they fantasize about Darius, they watch Moltisanti, they love Jesse. 
            Add all those variables into my life, then that should make the me best version of all of them.  
        </p>

            A man once told me time is a flat circle. 
            The same scenarios present themselves over and over, and more often than not people make the same mistakes over and over.
