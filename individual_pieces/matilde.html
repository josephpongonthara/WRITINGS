            Spoiler, her names not Matilde. 
            Perhaps my inebriation aided in this description but watching her fly-by had me in such a trance, she was moving full speed in a slow-motion world. 
            The streetlights reflected off her blonde highlights, her cheek bones pierced out like a Scandinavian model, she was a self-sustaining energy source. 
            Every detail of her being popped out at me as though the tab of acid kicked in and the placebo of intricate analysis had begun flowing through my veins.
        </p>
        <p> 
            I’ve been having commitment issues lately. School, shows, sex, sanity, all capture my attention for fleeting moments on rotation. 
            But this, her, my Matilde, was the high I needed to start my new addiction.
        </p>
        <p>
            My soul had finally found its new purpose, I hopped on my bike & started my pursuit for love. 
            She looked back; my eager eyes had been itching for the opportunity to look into her’s, & they did not disappoint. 
            As though I was on Caladan, the Atreides green cast a spell on me. 
            I should’ve known she was a member of the Bene Gesserit, this was my test, I will not succumb to the pain.
        </p>
        <p>
            She began to pick up speed, we were birds, flying past cars, buses, pedestrians, streetlights, traffic lights. 
            She signaled to the right, I followed, she went into the 7-11 parking lot, I went into the 7-11 parking lot, she locked her bike, 
            I locked my bike, she waltzed through aisle 7, I pranced through it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Past the Pringles & Powerade I pranced, while she wandered past the Werthers & Welches. 
            The power turned off; panic began to settle in as all I could hear were the wails from the homeless woman’s 4-year-old son & curses catapulting from the store owner. 
            Like an experienced pick-pocketer on the crowded streets of Paris, my Matilde acted fast, dragging me through the unknown into a world of debauchery.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m not epileptic but a warning would have been appreciated. 
            A maze of mirrors, a compilation of colors more diverse than all the life in the sea, and of course the coke lining every corset and cuff link in the building. 
            There were whores, hooligans, entrepreneurs, egalitarians, jesters, judges, David Spade & Anthony Bourdain. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My mind was racing, filled with possibilities of what the future would hold for me and my Matilde. 
            Still being dragged by my left hand, she found our own little cavern on this island of ecstasy. 
            Finally, she turned to face me, I was speechless, analyzing all her features, in this mosh pit of mayhem I was singularly focused on one thing. 
            She leaned in, whispering into my ear. 
            As the air from her breath hit my ears, she disappeared. 
            I had been dragged into Armageddon, lost in a paradise of perversion, with no hope of escape.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I woke up & had my morning coffee.
        </p>
