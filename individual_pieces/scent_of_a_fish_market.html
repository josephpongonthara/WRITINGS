            Everyone has the stench of a fish market ingrained in them. 
            A fringe traumatic experience, as ubiquitous as the ring from a homeless person’s Tim Horton’s cup as they beg on the corner of Yonge & Dundas. 
            The misplaced cheer from the underpaid, overworked server unfortunately fails to alleviate the sting one’s nostrils feel as he sifts through halibut, trout, and catfish piled up on one another.

            I watched Moonlight. 
            A beautiful tale of an inherently oppressed individual battling additional oppression from the very people he’s trying to escape his inherent oppression with. 
            Anything scored by Nicholas Britell is a personal must-watch, by the end of it I was in tears. 
            Not from the music, but my amplified homophobia.

            A boy sits with his father along a peak of a mountain lining the borders of rural Idaho. 
            “It’s beautiful isn’t it son, this is ours, no one else’s.” That boy took his son to that peak, and his son’s son, and his son’s son’s son. 
            They all died on that peak.

            The slums of Budapest are home to thousands. 
            With a perfect sight line to the medieval castles the public servants call their office, the enchanted basilicas that god’s servants call their home, 
            the thermal bath’s the rich & aristocratic call their confessionals, they look to one another and say “It’s beautiful isn’t it, this will never be ours.” 
            They all will die in those slums.

            A fisherman nears the end of her busy season, about to enjoy her hard-earned rest along the Amalfi Coast. 
            She has never stepped foot on land, and never plans to. 
            The water is her refuge, her sanctuary, it’s all she knows. 
            As she stares off the stern of her fair maiden, adoring the coastal sun shining against the ascending villas lining the Lattari Mountains, 
            she says to me “I’ll never understand why people live on land instead of water, but it’s beautiful all the same.”

            We’re all from different backgrounds, we’ll never understand why people do what they do, 
            to fully be in someone else’s shoes is a concept impossible for us to grasp, but regardless, all our lives are beautiful, all the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            What’s the most beautiful part about all our lives? We all agree a fish market is rancid.
