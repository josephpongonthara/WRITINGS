            I want to write about beauty. An indescribable feeling. 
            A visceral neuro-reaction stimulating all your senses, awakening many innate human desires often locked away for security purposes.
        </p>
        <p> 
            To be very clear this is an objective analysis of beauty. 
            I could give less of a fuck about an individuals character. 
            For the most part we are all rotten to our core, devoted members to the game run by a morally devious, manipulative cabal. 
            Cabal is a great word.
        </p>

            Outer beauty is the best representation of who we are. 
            Unlike corruption, faux-beauty cannot be covered up for long. 
            Masks will be removed revealing either beauty or filth. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A toned figure, unblemished skin, pristine facial structure, exemplary dental & scalp care, deep & colourful eyes, 
            and most importantly, defined cheekbones. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In a world where equality, in a variety of factions, is at the forefront of all socio-political agendas (made up word), 
            & those fighting for it the most ostentatious of our species, objective beauty is the only separator in a civilization of curated personalities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The pursuit of outer beauty is a noble one in my eyes. The sole honest representation of who we are in an unoriginal society. 
            None of our lives carry much meaning, but if you look unique enough, you can convince yourself that you do.        
         </p>
