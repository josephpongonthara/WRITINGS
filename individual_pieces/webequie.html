        <p>Brennan spends his days on the water. Operating a motorized canoe, 
            shotgunning down wildlife he encounters on his journey is how he seeks for peace.</p>
        <p> 
            A child of substance abuse, his inevitable reality as an addict began early. 
            All he knows are his extreme surroundings, not one of war-torn violence but one of emotional trauma. 
            Born to a people who are native to the land, weren’t forced to fight for the country, and as a result were economically neglected & ostracized for generations. 
            In a land of minimal/non-existent opportunities, where does a person find purpose? 
            Having been granted exposure & access to illicit substances at an early age, education was never an option. 
            The water is all he has left.

            Sharmaine is driven. 
            On the verge of completing high-school & moving to the big city of Thunder Bay to begin higher education. 
            As she walks down the snow-covered roads with her husky Chantel, every noise along the way evokes memories: 
            the birch branches rustling as the partridges attempt to escape the local hunters invading their personal space, 
            the whirring snowmobile engines as local wildlife enforcement pursue the hunters attacking the endangered species, 
            & Chantel’s howls’, she just wants the distractions to disappear so she can enjoy the only peaceful part of her existence. 
            Sharmaine is excited for the next chapter, she’s grown tired of the complacent life of living on the reserve. 
            But with 11 people in her community killing themselves over the past year, including her best friend, she just wonders if there will be any complacent lives to return to.

            Kenisha loves to wander. 
            Before & after school her body & soul wander throughout the third largest wetland in the world that her community calls home. 
            During school her mind wanders. 
            She likes to be out of the house, at home all she has waiting for her are dirty dishes her mother forces her to wash as she drinks & looks after her little brother, & the rancid smell of mold as it slowly eats up the walls of her house. 
            She prefers to roam outside with a picture of her incarcerated father on her at all times. She has one dream; learn to fly with the birds before she’s 10 so that she can show her dad when he finally comes home.
