            My laser focus is that of an assassin. I read a book when I was young, singular, just one book. 
            In it I remember the opening, the protagonist, brave, lonely, afraid, counting each second until his target was to be exposed. 
            I envy that level of determination. To eviscerate enemies one must be pragmatic and patient. Who is this enemy you ask. Myself.

            Introspection is a vice, you are made more aware of imperfection which haunt you for the rest of your days. 
            No one’s perfect and aspiring to be leads to madness, what a cruel joke.

            The worst kind of women are those too insecure about their appearance that they act as a protector to their fellow kin who possess beauty.

            My writing will become a collection of well articulated tenets. I plan on writing a manifesto, I’m not a mass shooter, just miserable.

            The inspiration for these tenets. Heisenberg. RIP Gale.
