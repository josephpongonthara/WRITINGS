            Staring into the ceiling mirrors at Pub, I began to think about how fitting it would be to film a movie here. 
            3 years spent, 1 in my room, the 2nd in a cage & the 3rd finally free. 
            I went to college, I served my time, I am a bird released from captivity, and I’m supposed to enjoy it.
        </p>
        <p> 
            I’d be a liar if I said it hasn’t been a blast. Receiving attention (wanted & unwanted), 
            the spontaneous eye contact & smile, forming relationships (wanted & unwanted) & of course, getting drunk.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like a fever dream, the loop restarts, I’ve re-entered the same simulation I’ve been abusing for the past 8 months. 
            Will I ever stop, no. As I’ve said before, I’m a sucker for drama.
        </p>
        <p>
            Game resumes. Holy shit, I’m here again. My blink time doubles, as expected, but wow there are so many people. 
            Like a drug the enjoyment of walking into a packed bar is exhilarating no matter how many times it’s been done before. 
            However, sobriety always kicks in at some point and I realize that I’ve seen this a million times.
        </p>
        <p>
            Robot-like I ignore my rational thoughts, and plug back into my role as a jester in a crowded circus filled with people who deep down are feeling the same way I am. 
            Now I begin going through the same levels I’ve completed a thousand times over. 
            ATM, Wait at the bar, 1 Whiskey Sour 2 Pub Bombs, Round of hellos, go to the bathroom, drink from flask, fake a phone call, drink from flask again, NOW, the night’s begun.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feeling somewhat accomplished, I’m finally ready to socialize. 
            I’ve bought into the illusion, I’m going to have a mind-numbing, meaningless, dopamine filled, entertaining night. 
            The ecstasy is prematurely kicking in, fuck it, I’m ready for fireworks; however, an unfamiliar face appears. 
            Wait! It’s familiar, “how are you doing” the face says, with the liquid courage I’ve injected into my veins I decide to speak my mind, 
            I say, to be honest I want to leave. 
            She replies “why would you leave, you’re drunk and at Pub, you’re supposed to have fun here.” 
        </p>
        <p>
            Angels appear in the strangest forms. 
            Tonight, she was my angel. The chains were broken, the game began to glitch. 
            In that split second I realized, fuck this game. 
            I’m leaving.
        </p>
