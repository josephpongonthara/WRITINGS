            I think back to a time of optimism, where I looked towards the future and thought of every dream I wanted to accomplish, with a hope of one day being in that position whatever it may be. 
            So how is it I ended up in a mindset, of emptiness, of hopelessness, with no desire to do anything but purchase my next pack of cigarettes and bottle of wine and whisky, to sit and drown myself in that old hope.

            I look upon the lives of others and sit in pure jealousy. 
            I want what they have. 
            Incorrect, rather than live their lives I prefer to ruin it because of my selfish nature filled with desires to destroy rather than build. 
            Is it a call for attention, a respect I crave from others? Built upon a false ideology that people care for what I think, what I do, when in reality everyone lies, everyone wants what they want and nothing more. 
            They’ll discard everything and everyone they care about for that feeling of supreme power and authority because everyone wants to be a God.

            That everlasting love and peace taught to us by religions, the prospect of an afterlife eats at all of us: what is next? 
            I cannot imagine what comes after, maintaining my conscious brain where I can relive and reminisce, 
            but why because life inherently is a depressing subject filled with call backs to what was. 
            Those euphoric moments, those developed relationships, those long lasting memories. 
            Everyone aims to up the peak they hit before, similar to drugs after they wear off. 
            You climb and climb until its all over, but when its over what do we gain, the memories of once was, no we sit in emptiness.
            "Remember when is the lowest form of conversation" - an individual who never had the makings of a varsity athelte.

            This life is an illusion for an the death of existence, because we are merely a mass of particles, 
            distracted by our ability to think and dream. 
            We dreamed of constructing a world where we all can live freely, 
            but in reality this structure is created so that we can dream of conquering that, 
            and when you realize that is when you realize the trivialness of life you lose purpose, 
            fall into the neurological temptations to distract your mind as much as possible because you know that nothing comes next. 
            You’ve pieced together the puzzle which we all crave only to realize this puzzle is all an illusion.
